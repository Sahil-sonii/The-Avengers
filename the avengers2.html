<h1><big><i><font color="white">
Killmonger, played by the wonderful Michel B. Jordan, is one of the MCU's best Marvel villains because he's fighting for a cause that is actually quite reasonable.
 It's not just one pure evil guy (or woman) versus the heroes. A lot of thought and backstory was put into Killmonger, and it didn't start with what makes him evil.By prioritizing his motivations and personality, director and screenwriter Ryan Coogler made one of the MCU's best villains, and one of the best villains in movie history.

The MCU wouldn't be the same without Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Loki is the, for lack of a better word, emo adopted son of Odin and Thor's brother. 
He's always felt second best, and tries to give himself something to live for by being bad. He loves his brother , and no matter how much they hate each other,
 they'd actually do anything for each other when their lives depend on it. Loki is complicated and has more emotional depth than most villains in any movie.

Vulture, or Adrian Toomes, played by a very well-cast Michael Keaton , who probably got this role for appearing as another man with wings in 'Birdman' , is one of the rare villains in the MCU 
that has a personal vendetta against the superheroes who doesn't feel like a desperate tie-in.
The battle in 2012's 'The Avengers' affected his livelihood: He ran a company that cleaned up damage from superhero battles.But the Department of Damage Control, put together by the federal government with the help of Tony Stark, caused the company to fold. 
 In their final battle, Spider-Man saves Vulture's life. In prison, Vulture refuses to reveal Spider-Man's real identity, 
 proving that his arc throughout the movie is worth investing in.

 He's a one-note villain, but Hugo Weaving's performance makes him more terrifying than what was on the page. He was also seen in "Avengers: Infinity War" as a Infinity stone protector because in "Captain America: The first Avenger" he touched the Tesseract cube , which is also a Infinity stone . And this stone doesn't touched by Human being

As the first villain in the first MCU movie ever, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) defined what these villains could and should be.
First appearing as a mentor to our hero, Tony Stark, the twist is that Obadiah has been planning to take over the company,

Helmut Zemo blurs the lines between a desperate tie-in and a successful one. It works, but by a small margin. Zemo hates the Avengers - and plots to pit Captain America and 
Iron Man against each other - because his family was crushed by a building in Slovakia during the Avengers' battle with Ultron in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' .
 It's refreshing to see some consequences for the damage superheroes cause.
 Their heroic actions result in damaged cities and dozens of deaths that create vengeful villains.

<h1><big><i><font color="white">
Ultron (voiced by 80s heartthrob James Spader) was an interesting concept: a monster created by Tony Stark himself. Stark's intentions, of course, were to save the world with Ultron's artificial intelligence capabilities, but Ultron gained a conscience and along with that came a hatred for humanity. Ultron's goal was to wipe humans out, leaving only metal. Ultron was fine, but his goals intentions were a stretch. 
The best thing about Ultron is that his origins paved the way for Stark and the heroes in the MCU to face serious consequences for their actions,
 starting with 'Captain America: Civil War.'

'Iron Man 2' is a pointless bore. But its saving grace (besides Don Cheadle's first appearance in the MCU) is Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer.

'Ant-Man' was surprisingly good. It's funny, silly, and a successful tonal shift from the other MCU movies that paved the way for a great movie like 'Thor Ragnarok.'
 But its villain, Yellowjacket was taken a little too seriously, and like most on this list, wasn't memorable.
 The good movie could've been a great one if the sense of humor that defined the movie was applied to its villain.
 Instead, Yellowjacket applies the same personality, choices, and motivations as Obadiah Stane from 'Iron Man.'

 Malekith has backstory and motivation is pretty much that he likes night? Thanks to Thor, the world never actually went dark.
